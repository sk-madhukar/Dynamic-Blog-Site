# Dynamic-Blog-Site
This project goes by the name Dynamic blog website. The purpose for this project was to design a website where the authors could add blog pages and bloggers could read the author's blog. And for this I made a dashboard where the authors and bloggers could have different access like the author role where the author would access to create delete and edit to all of his/her blogs. There is also a superuser admin just like in databases who will have all access. For the website i also used the search feature where the bloggers could search for different keywords for different sections in blogging like science, sports, entertainment and author's name to access the author's blogs. Here the backend was build in php and mysql. Since this was my first project so all the learning was the key learning and I could learn to design databases.
